# Answer for Mission 3: Indicate UI parts that can be improved

The current UI is compacted, but it won't be easy to find a specific email if the amount of emails that need to be checked is big.
So I would like to add additional search boxes and filters to support it.

## 0. Add an actual date-picker box below the current search-by-date box

This might not be an improvement, but what should be done anyway in the real case. By clicking the calendar icon, a date picker should be opened which allowed users to select the date from it instead of typing in like what I did right now.

## 1. Additional search box

A search box that allowed users to search by keywords or specific sender can be added in the search box area.
Based on the real use-case, we can search through everything, or only title, or email with attachment only, etc, by adding check-boxes to combine with this search box.

## 2. Filter by email tag

Many of the emails have a tag with it which can help identify it quickly, like "[HR - 888]".
By grouping them by tags, search by category can be done quickly.

Grouping through a large number of emails might take longer, so I would put this on a new page, which is "advanced search".

## 3. Options to mark emails as "checked" or "is related" to the current incident

For each incident, there would be related, and unrelated emails, which the person who is checking a large number of emails might be confused if not noted down correctly. So I would like to save the list of them (which needs help from the back-end too), which can be seen & edited quickly by a small check-box.

**And for now, that concluded my ideas for this UI improvement.  I hope that I would have the chance to understand the problems better to come up with better solutions for them.**
